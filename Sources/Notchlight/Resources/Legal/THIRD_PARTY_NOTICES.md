The upstream license follows. Its permissions remain available independently
of Notchlight's license for material covered by that upstream license.

Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any
purpose with or without fee is hereby granted.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES
WITH
REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL,
DIRECT,
INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER RESULTING
FROM
LOSS OF USE, DATA OR PROFITS, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHER TORTIOUS ACTION, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE USE OR
PERFORMANCE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

## Platform components

Notchlight uses Apple system frameworks, system-provided SF Symbols, the Swift
runtime, and the system SQLite library. These remain subject to their respective
rights and terms; Notchlight claims no ownership of them. SQLite's core is
dedicated to the public domain: https://sqlite.org/copyright.html.

The optional integration invokes the user's existing Codex installation.
Codex is not redistributed in the Notchlight app. Apple, macOS, MacBook, OpenAI,
and Codex names belong to their respective owners. Notchlight is independent
and is not endorsed by Apple or OpenAI.

## Project artwork and research

Notchlight's icon was developed from an AI-generated project concept and
recreated as editable SVG layers. AI provenance is documented in the local
design records; no Apple or OpenAI logo is included in the icon.

Apple's Landmarks sample was consulted during development. Its source and
photographs are not included in this repository's release or app bundle.

## Sparkle 2.10.1

Notchlight bundles Sparkle for verified software updates.
